🗂️ Document Classifier Website
This is a simple web application that allows users to upload a text file and automatically classifies the type of content inside (e.g., legal, medical, educational, technical, etc.). It's designed for quick and easy document classification without requiring any technical knowledge from the user.

🚀 Features
Upload .txt files through a simple web interface

Automatically detects and displays the category of the document

Supports common document types like:

Legal

Medical

Educational

Technical

News/Article

Others

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (can be React or plain depending on implementation)

Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI/Django) or Node.js

Machine Learning Model: Pre-trained text classification model (e.g., scikit-learn, spaCy, BERT, etc.)

📦 Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/document-classifier.git
cd document-classifier
Set up the backend:
If using Python:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
Run the frontend:
Open index.html in your browser, or serve it using a lightweight server like live-server.

🧪 How It Works
User uploads a .txt file using the form on the homepage.

The file is sent to the backend via an API call.

The backend processes the file and passes its content to the classification model.

The predicted category is sent back and displayed to the user.

⚠️ Limitations
Only supports .txt files.

Accuracy depends on the dataset used to train the model.

Not suitable for very large documents or files with non-text content (e.g., images, scanned PDFs).
